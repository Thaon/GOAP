\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_action}{Action} \\*A \hyperlink{class_g_o_a_p}{G\+O\+A\+P} action can have a set of requirements and a cost, it then has an effect when completed so that the planner can use it to satisfy a \hyperlink{class_goal}{Goal} }{\pageref{class_action}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_f_s_m}{F\+S\+M} \\*the \hyperlink{class_f_s_m}{F\+S\+M} class covers the bare minimum to provide \hyperlink{class_g_o_a_p}{G\+O\+A\+P} Agents with a way to transition between the 3 main states\+: Idle Move Perform }{\pageref{class_f_s_m}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{interface_f_s_m_state}{F\+S\+M\+State} \\*An interface for concrete implemetations of \hyperlink{class_f_s_m}{F\+S\+M} states }{\pageref{interface_f_s_m_state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_goal}{Goal} }{\pageref{class_goal}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_g_o_a_p}{G\+O\+A\+P} }{\pageref{class_g_o_a_p}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_goap_agent}{Goap\+Agent} }{\pageref{class_goap_agent}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_g_o_a_p_planner}{G\+O\+A\+P\+Planner} \\*The Planner takes care of providing each agent with a queue of actions that they can perform to achieve their goal. The following code has been copied as is from \href{https://github.com/sploreg/goap/blob/master/Assets/Standard%20Assets/Scripts/AI/GOAP/GoapPlanner.cs}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/sploreg/goap/blob/master/\+Assets/\+Standard\%20\+Assets/\+Scripts/\+A\+I/\+G\+O\+A\+P/\+Goap\+Planner.\+cs}. This has been done as, after an analysys of the code, it was considered impossible to create a version of it that would do the same job in a significantly different way. Therefore the entirety of Brent Owens' code was just copied and refactored to integrate with the existing codebase. }{\pageref{class_g_o_a_p_planner}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{interface_i_goap}{I\+Goap} \\*Any agent that wants to use \hyperlink{class_g_o_a_p}{G\+O\+A\+P} must implement this interface. It provides information to the \hyperlink{class_g_o_a_p}{G\+O\+A\+P} planner so it can plan what actions to use. It also provides an interface for the planner to give feedback to the Agent and report success/failure. }{\pageref{interface_i_goap}}{}
