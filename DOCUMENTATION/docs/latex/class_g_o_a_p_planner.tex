The Planner takes care of providing each agent with a queue of actions that they can perform to achieve their goal. The following code has been copied as is from \href{https://github.com/sploreg/goap/blob/master/Assets/Standard%20Assets/Scripts/AI/GOAP/GoapPlanner.cs}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/sploreg/goap/blob/master/\+Assets/\+Standard\%20\+Assets/\+Scripts/\+A\+I/\+G\+O\+A\+P/\+Goap\+Planner.\+cs}. This has been done as, after an analysys of the code, it was considered impossible to create a version of it that would do the same job in a significantly different way. Therefore the entirety of Brent Owens' code was just copied and refactored to integrate with the existing codebase.
